# 70 cm Low Gain Radio Communications Transceiver

## Regulatory :us:

* **Frequency:** 436.5MHz  (70cm (420-450 MHz)) 
* **Power:** 1W
* **Band Plan** (Ref: http://www.arrl.org/band-plan)
    * 435.00-438.00	Satellite only (internationally)	

### Power Regulations

* There is a geographical power limitation on the 70cm band which does not apply at this frequency or output power.

   * Ref: FCC §97.313 Transmitter power standards. 

> (f) No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 50 W PEP on the
>     UHF 70 cm band from an area specified in paragraph (a) of footnote US270 in
>     §2.106, unless expressly authorized by the FCC after mutual agreement, on a
>     case-by-case basis, between the District Director of the applicable field
>     facility and the military area frequency coordinator at the applicable military
>     base. An Earth station or telecommand station, however, may transmit on the
>     435-438 MHz segment with a maximum of 611 W effective radiated power (1 kW
>     equivalent isotropically radiated power) without the authorization otherwise
>     required. The transmitting antenna elevation angle between the lower half-power
>     (−3 dB relative to the peak or antenna bore sight) point and the horizon must
>     always be greater than 10°. 

### Auxiliary Station Operation

**NOTE** *This needs review*

* **Ref:**  http://www.arrl.org/auxiliary-station-faq

> What is an auxiliary station?- When an amateur station, such as a repeater, is
> remotely controlled over a radio link, there is another station involved--the
> station doing the controlling. This "control" station is, under the FCC rules,
> called an auxiliary station defined by the FCC as "An amateur station, other
> than a message forwarding system, that is transmitting comunications
> point-to-point within a system of cooperating amateur stations [97.3(a)(7)]."
> There are a few important rules that apply to auxiliary stations: 1) All
> amateurs, except Novices, may put auxiliary stations on the air [97.201(a)]. 2)
> An auxiliary station may transmit only on the 2 m and shorter wavelength bands,
> except the 144.0-144.5 MHz, 145.8-146.0 MHz, 219-220 MHz, 222.00-222.15 MHz,
> 431-433 MHz, and 435-438 MHz segments. 3) When there is interference, licensees
> are equally responsible for solving the interference, except where one station
> is coordinated and the other is not [97.201(c)]. Control links should be
> coordinated. 4) An auxiliary station may, under certain circumstances, be
> automatically controlled and may send one-way transmissions [97.201(d), (e)].
