### C Source Code Style 

* See the explanation in psas.astylerc

#### Comments

* The goal of picking a coding **Style** is that consistent coding style makes it easier to read code. Style refers to the textural layout of the characters in the file such as where the parenthesis go (attached or not), indentation style (tabs, spaces, or mixed) etc. 

* Multiple tools are available to format text, the 'Artistic Style' tool and configuration presented above is intended to document the style, you can use any tool you like that achieves the same results.

### PSAS Coding Standard

* TBDiscussed

* Requirement proposed: Ruleset checker for any standard we do pick.
* Requirement proposed: Any standard with a non-open source license is probably not going to be used.
